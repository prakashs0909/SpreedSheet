# ✨ React Spreadsheet Prototype

> Front-end-only static spreadsheet UI prototype built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS — designed to match the Figma design pixel-perfectly.

## 💡 Goal

Build a **static, front-end-only prototype** that visually matches the Figma design and provides a Google Sheets/Excel-like spreadsheet experience.
